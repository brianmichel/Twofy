            Getting two factor codes from your Messages app into your browser is
            pain and there is no API to allow browser developers to easily get
            these codes. Twofy is an open sourced, sandboxed application that
            helps automate this process without any hassle.

        <h2 class="text-3xl py-3">Why?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This idea isn't new, but it a continuation of the same ideas that have
          been used in Alfred, Raycast, and countless other helper applications
          in the open source world. I wanted something that would work in all of
          the browsers that I use. I also wanted the application to be sandboxed
          and easily verifiable that no networking was taking place to ensure my
          codes were being securely handled.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          It's important to me that something that can read your text messages
          is open source which allows anyone to inspect the code running on
          their machine and make an informed decision about that piece of
          software.

      <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2 class="text-3xl py-3">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When Twofy prompts you for the Messages directory this grants the
          application access to read the database where all of the messages you
          receive live on disk. The application can then set up a polling
          listener on that database to find codes that match a particular regex.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          If the query finds anything it dispatches an encrypted distributed
          notification that can only be decrypted by the helper application that
          the browser extension communicates with. Once that browser support
          application receives that notification, it decrypts it and sends it
          into the service worker within the browser extension process.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Twofy is simple, but feature rich to help make your workflows a bit
          more straightforward when needing just-in-time access to your two
          factor authentication codes that have been sent via text message.
